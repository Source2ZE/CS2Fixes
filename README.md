## Why is this all one plugin? Why "CS2Fixes"?

Reimplementing all these features as standalone plugins would duplicate quite a lot of code between each. Metamod is not much more than a loader & hook manager, so many common modding features need a fair bit of boilerplate to work with. And since our primary goal is developing CS2Fixes for all zombie escape servers, there is not necessarily a drawback to distributing our work in this form at the moment.

The CS2Fixes name comes from the CSSFixes and CSGOFixes projects, which were primarily aimed at low-level bug fixes and improvements for their respective games. Long term, we see this plugin slimming down and becoming more similar to them. Since as the CS2 modding scene matures, common things like an admin system and RTV become more feasible in source2mod or a similar modding platform.
